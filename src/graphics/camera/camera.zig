// Main interface and setup for the camera.

// This file unifies functionality by exposing a Camera struct and any main functions for setting up
// or updating the camera. It might import other modules (like transform, projection, view, and vector)
// and provide helper functions for initializing and updating the camera based on position, orientation,
// and projection settings.
